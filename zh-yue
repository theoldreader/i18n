        <p>The Old Reader is adding new paid account plans to help fund the maintenance and development of this service.
        The new paid plans will offer the following benefits:
        <ul>
          %{summary}
        </ul></p>
        <p>We're working diligently to make this the best RSS reader on the web and hope that you'll consider upgrading 
        to the premium version for only $%{price} per month (yearly discounts available).</p>
        <p><strong>A free plan will also be available for users who have less than %{free_limit} subscriptions.</strong> While the free 
        version does not include all the premium features, you can rest assured that all of the great features that are 
        available today will be available going forward (and we'll add more free features along the way).</p>
        %{limit_specific_message}
        <p>Please <a href='http://blog.theoldreader.com/post/76417559063'>read our blog post</a> for more information on the change.</p>
      over_limit_message: |
        <p>We'll keep things as they are for you for a couple weeks so you can take your time to decide. After these two
        weeks, you can upgrade to a premium version, or remove subscriptions to qualify for the free plan. You currrently
        have <strong>%{current_count}</strong> subscriptions.</p>
